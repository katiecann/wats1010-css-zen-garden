#Design Concepts

COONCEPT:  My design will be based on clarity, balance, and calm.  The Sidebar and Footer elements will be mirrors of one another, balanced on opposite ends of the page.  A large header text or image will be balanced by the Summary and two links immediately beside it.  I plan to use a calming neutral color scheme of cool, natural tones.  

IMPACT:  I hope the user encounters the page and finds it open, calming, and easily navigable.
